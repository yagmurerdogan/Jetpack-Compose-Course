    --- Introduction to MVC, MVP and MVVM ---

    Presentation patterns are design patterns,
     and they are here to help us in developing
     good applications  and scalable projects
     that have decoupled components.

    --- MVC

    View(xml) -> Controller Activity ->Model

    Disadvantages:

    Your code is highly coupled - no separation of concerns
    Difficult to test
    The project is difficult to maintain
    Little scalability

    --- MVP

    View(Activity/Fragment) <-> Presenter -> Model

    --- MVVM

    View(Activity/Fragment) -> ViewModel -> Model

    Advantages:

    Your code is decoupled - separation of concerns
    Code is easily testable
    The package structure is even easier to navigate
    THe project is even easier to maintain
    Scalable - your team can add new features even more
    quickly

    -> ViewModel is a class that is responsible for
    preparing and managing the state of the UI for
    Fragments or Activities, or composable.

    Gson deserialization:
    JSON -> data classes
